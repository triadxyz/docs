# Referral

_In Atlantis, every traveler plays a crucial role in our ecosystem. With our referral system, you can expand your influence and earn rewards. Share your unique link, and when someone joins through it, you benefit from their activities with a special Boost._

## How It Works

_Invite friends to join Triad, and both of you will be rewarded. You’ll earn extra Tridents based on their performance throughout the season, receiving a percentage of the Tridents they accumulate. It’s an easy way to boost your own rewards while helping grow the Triad community._

● _**Referee**: Earn a 10% bonus based on the total Tridents collected by your referred player during the season._

## The Gods of Sea: Triad Leaderboard

_The Gods of Sea is our leaderboard, where the most skilled and dedicated players compete for the top spot. Throughout the Atlantis Season, players earn Tridents by completing missions, making trades, staking, and participating in platform activities, striving to become legends of the sea._
