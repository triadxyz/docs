# Triad: Atlantis Season Points

The Atlantis season of Triad is our most ambitious yet, bringing an exciting combination of rewards, missions, and multipliers that encourage active participation on the platform. Tridents, the prestige points of Triad, will be distributed as players complete daily, weekly, and seasonal missions, as well as engage in trades, staking, and other essential activities within the Triad ecosystem.

- Saying "Gm" in our Discord
- Staking a certain amount of $TRD
- Swapping to $TRD
- Staking the NFT for a set period
- And various other interactive activities with the platform.
