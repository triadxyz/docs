# Season FAQ

# How to Unlock the Season

To access the **Season screen** and all the new features released with it, users must first **interact with the Triad Markets platform** by making at least **one prediction**.

This initial interaction serves as an activation step. Once you place a prediction worth a **minimum of $1**, your account will automatically unlock **full access** to the following features:

- Season dashboard
- Missions
- Leaderboards
- All season features

### In Short:

**Make at least one prediction (min. $1)** = **Unlock the full Season experience.**

This requirement ensures that all users participating in the season are **active members** of the Triad Markets ecosystem.

## What Are Triad Points?

**Triad Points** are the official points system of the Triad Markets platform — a kind of internal currency that users earn by completing missions, joining events, or engaging with the community.

These points can be used to:

- Climb the seasonal leaderboard.
- Unlock exclusive rewards.
- Gain benefits within the ecosystem.

The more points you accumulate, the better your rewards.

## How Do I Earn Triad Points?

You can earn Triad Points by completing daily, weekly, and seasonal missions, participating in events, and engaging with the Triad Markets community.

## Point Boosters

Season Multipliers are powered by your **NFTs**:

- **Poseidon NFTs:** Multiplier based on the total combined power, up to **6x**.
- **Collection NFT:** Grants a **1.05x** multiplier.
- **Triad Pickaxe:** Grants a **1.5x** multiplier.

## Are Boosters Cumulative?

**Yes!** Boosters are cumulative — but with a few important rules:

1.  If you own **different types** of NFTs (such as Pickaxe, Poseidon, and Collection), their multipliers stack, increasing your total point gain on claim.
2.  However, owning **multiple NFTs of the same type** (e.g., two Pickaxes or two Collections) does not provide extra multiplication — **only one of each type counts.**
3.  The exception is the **Poseidon NFT**: you can level it up to increase its multiplier.

### How to Level Up Poseidon

You can level up Poseidon in two ways:

- **Burning TRD** — every $1 in TRD = 3 power points.
- **Burning another Poseidon NFT** that you own.
