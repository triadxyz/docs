# Poseidons Collection - Triad NFTs

The Poseidons Collection is an exclusive series of 1,633 NFTs inspired by the legendary God of the Sea. Each Poseidon is unique, with distinct characteristics and rarities that make every NFT a rare and powerful asset. Combining mythology, art, and exclusive utilities, these NFTs unlock unique opportunities within the Triad ecosystem.

The technology behind Poseidon NFTs is built on Metaplex, one of the leading infrastructures for NFT collections on Solana, ensuring security, transparency, and immutability of digital assets.

With different rarities and traits, each Poseidon provides benefits such as multipliers for Atlantis, daily minigames, and access to exclusive events. But this is just the beginning...

### Collection Rarities

Each Poseidon has an assigned rarity that influences its value and the utilities it offers. The rarities are distributed as follows:

- Mythic: 1% of NFTs
- Legendary: 5% of NFTs
- Epic: 15% of NFTs
- Rare: 35% of NFTs
- Uncommon: 60% of NFTs
- Common: 100% of NFTs

 **Special Badges - Extra Rarity**

Within the collection, some NFTs feature exclusive Badges, making them even more valuable. Only those who minted and kept their NFT staked received this special Badge. Since this benefit can no longer be earned, these NFTs are extremely rare and highly sought after in the secondary market.

**Where to Buy**

 Poseidons are available on the Tensor and Magic Eden marketplaces. However, we recommend using Tensor, as it provides a clearer display of the collection's rarities, making it easier to assess the value and exclusivity of each NFT.
