# Mining Pool FAQ

## About the Mining Pool and Pickaxes

### Is the Mining Pool official from Ore?

No. The mining pool is officially from Triad and has no relation to ORE.

### Are the pickaxes official ORE products?

No. The pickaxes serve only as a tracking method for the division of our mining pool and token staking.

## Operation and Rewards

### Do I need to keep mining on my computer or phone to receive rewards?

No. By holding a Pickax, you are eligible to receive rewards. However, by contributing to the mining pool using your computational power, you have a chance to find a hashrate and earn an additional 30% in rewards.

### Where can I mine?

The mining widget is available in our application: <a href="https://ore.triadfi.co" target="_blank">https://ore.triadfi.co</a>

### What are the benefits of the pickaxe?

- Rewards through the widget tool can only be earned if you own a Pickax.
- Each pickaxe is equivalent to 5x in season points multipliers on Triad.
- Exposure to rewards and new functionalities along with the NFT and our mining pool.

### How can I increase my mining earnings?

It's not necessary to use your devices to earn rewards, but by using them to contribute to the Mining Pool, you increase your chances of finding a more difficult hashrate and obtaining up to 30% bonus. Ideally, use a VPS, but you can contribute hashpower with a browser as well.

### How does the reward distribution work?

Rewards will be distributed weekly on Fridays, with an announcement in a specific Discord channel (mine-rewards). The announcement will detail the mined value and the amount to be paid, which will be automatically transferred to wallets that own the Pickax.
