# *Ticker price:*

The ticker prices are derived from cryptocurrencies and various other factors that contribute to significant volatility in the investment market. These values are not static and fluctuate based on market sentiment. At TriadFi, we offer a sophisticated way to invest in the Solana ecosystem. We recommend that you carefully assess the risks mentioned above and be fully aware.

We do not use the token price in the protocol as the main parameter. Each data available on the blockchain serves as a parameter for calculating the ticker price.

The ticker price is updated every 5 minutes.

*Total TX* has a weight of 3.69;
*User active* weight of 9.6;
*Transaction failure* weight of 0.369,
*Token price* weight of 0.0369.

Based on this, the ticker price is calculated. If the protocol does not have the token, the value of 0 dollars is used as the Default as the token has no price.
