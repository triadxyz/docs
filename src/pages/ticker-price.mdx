# **Ticker price**

The ticker prices are derived from cryptocurrencies and various other factors that contribute to significant volatility in the investment market. These values are not static and fluctuate based on market sentiment. At TriadFi, we offer a sophisticated way to invest in the Solana ecosystem. We recommend that you carefully assess the aforementioned risks and remain fully aware of them.

We do not use the token price in the protocol as the main parameter. Each piece of data available on the blockchain serves as a parameter for calculating the ticker price.

The ticker price is updated every 5 minutes.

*Total TX* has a weight of 3.69%;
*User active* weight of 9.6%;
*Transaction failure* weight of 0.369%,
*Token price* weight of 0.0369%.

Based on this, the ticker price is calculated. If the protocol does not have the token, a value of $0 is used as the default since, as the token has no price.
