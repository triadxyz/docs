# Deposits and Currency Conversion

All activity on Triad is conducted in **USDC**, ensuring stability and transparency.

## Automatic Swap to USDC

Even if you deposit using Brazilian reais (**BRL**) or another local currency, the platform automatically performs a **swap to USDC** at the current exchange rate.

### Transaction Logic:

This means that when you place a prediction—for example, wagering the equivalent of **10 BRL**—your stake is actually represented and settled in **USDC**.

The same logic applies to any previous use of **TRD**; all transactions and balances are now denominated in **USDC**.
