# General

_General missions offer a unique opportunity to accumulate points and actively participate in the community. By staking $TRD, you not only contribute to the stability of the ecosystem but are also rewarded for it. Additionally, by staking your NFTs, you enhance your earnings, reflecting the value and rarity of the items you possess. For those who venture into operations, for every dollar invested, you accumulate 10 Tridents._

## Quests

_The quests are divided into four distinct phases: General, Daily, Weekly, and Season. Each of these phases offers a specific set of quests, each with a determined score._

- ⭐ **Daily Quests**
*Quests updated daily, encouraging continuous participation.*

- 📅 **Weekly Quests**
*Quests that renew weekly, allowing the accumulation of points in longer cycles.*

- 🏆 **Season Quests**
*Special quests with greater duration and significance, enabling higher scores within the season. Each phase assigns a defined number of quests and points, offering opportunities for progress at different paces.*
