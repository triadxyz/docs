 **Fees for Opening Market Orders**

 Market order fees are not fixed; they vary based on the following formula:

<FormulaBox>
  Fee = 0.01 × Shares × Price × (1 - Price)
</FormulaBox>

### Calculation Examples:

- For 10,000 shares at a price of 0.5:

<FormulaBox>
  Fee = 0.01 × 10 000 × 0.5 × (1 - 0.5) 25 shares as Fee
</FormulaBox>


- For 10,000 shares at a price of 0.9:

<FormulaBox>
  Fee = 0.01 × 10 000 × 0.9 × (1 - 0.9) 9 shares as Fee
</FormulaBox>
