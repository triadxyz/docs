# Triad Fees

Understand how fees work on the Triad platform in a simple and clear way.

## How Fees Work

### Buy and Sell Fees

![Dynamic Fee Structure](/images/fee-chart.png)

Triad uses a fee system that changes depending on the price:

- **Low prices (up to $0.90)**: 1.9% fee
- **High prices ($0.91 to $0.99)**: Reduced fee from 1.78% down to 0.9%
- **Smooth transition**: The higher the price, the lower the fee

### Detailed Fee Table

This table shows exactly how much you pay in fees for each entry price:

- **Green Zone ($0.91-$0.99)**: Reduced fees
- **Blue Zone ($0.10-$0.90)**: Standard 1.9% fee
- **Automatic calculation**: You always know how much you'll pay

## Payout Fee (When You Win)

### What happens when you win:

**✅ Winning Scenario (You were right):**

- You get your investment back
- Plus the profits from your prediction
- A 0.36% payout fee is charged **only on profits**
- Example: Invested $100, won $200 → Fee of $0.72 (only on the $200 profit)

**❌ Losing Scenario (You were wrong):**

- You lose your investment
- **No fee is charged** (you already lost)

## Practical Example

### $1000 Investment

1. **Buy**: You pay the trading fee (0.9% to 1.9%)
2. **If you win**: 0.36% fee only on profit

- Example: Invested $1000, won $2000 → Fee of $7.2 (only on the $2000 profit)

3. **If you lose**: No additional fee

### Why these fees?

- **Lower fees at high prices**: Encourages trading in balanced markets
- **Low payout fee**: You keep almost all your winnings
- **Complete transparency**: You always know how much you'll pay
