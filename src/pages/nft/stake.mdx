# Triad Staking System

The initial staking sessions are fully funded by the amount raised during the mint and the fees from trades on Triad.

## Staking Basics

### Stake, Unstake, and Withdraw

- You can stake your NFTs or $TRD tokens at any time
- Unstaking is available at any time
- Withdrawal periods:
  - NFTs: 3-day lock period
  - $TRD tokens: 7-day lock period

### Requirements for Staking

To participate, you must own at least one of the following:

- An NFT from the TRIAD collection
- $TRD tokens

## TRIAD NFT Rarities

Each NFT in the TRIAD collection has one of the following rarities (based on the Rarity Rank 1 - 1633):

| Rarity    | Reward Potential |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| Mythic    | Highest          |
| Legendary | Very High        |
| Epic      | High             |
| Rare      | Medium           |
| Uncommon  | Low              |
| Common    | Lowest           |

## Reward Multipliers

Boost your staking rewards by owning NFTs from partner collections:

| Partner Collection | Multiplier |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Pyth Alligators    | 1.5x       |
| 200 $Pyth stake    | 1.5x       |
| Coleta PFP         | 1.5x       |
| Undead Pikenians   | 1.5x       |

**Note**: Multipliers are applied only if you own NFTs from these collections.
