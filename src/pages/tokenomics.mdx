## Token Allocation Breakdown

### Triad NFT Holders (1%)

This allocation is set aside to reward our earliest supporters—the Triad NFT holders—who have been with us since the beginning. Their belief in the project before it gained wider recognition has been instrumental in our development. By allocating 1% of the total supply to them, we aim to honor their commitment and provide a tangible benefit for their early trust.

### Strategic Partners (2.95%)

Strategic partnerships are crucial for expanding Triad's ecosystem and enhancing our network's strength. This 2.95% allocation will reward those partners that contribute to the project's strategic objectives and help create a robust network of alliances. Through collaboration with key projects and communities, these tokens will support integrations, joint initiatives, and long-term growth.

### Exchange Listings (5%)

To ensure $TRD's availability and liquidity on prominent centralized exchanges (CEX) and (DEX), 5% of the token supply will be allocated for listing purposes. This strategic allocation is essential to facilitate seamless trading, expand market reach, and increase token accessibility, ultimately contributing to a healthy trading environment and boosting the project's visibility.

### Triad Foundation (11.01%)

The Triad Foundation plays a pivotal role in maintaining liquidity, overseeing the protocol's continuous development, and driving ecosystem growth. This 11.01% allocation will ensure that there is sufficient liquidity throughout the token's life cycle and that funds are available for initiatives such as grants, incentives, and the long-term sustainability of the Triad ecosystem.

### Core Team (9.59%)

Our core team has been instrumental in bringing the Triad vision to life, dedicating their expertise and hard work to building the platform. This 9.59% allocation ensures that the team remains motivated and aligned with the project's future success, with a vesting schedule that incentivizes long-term commitment. It reflects the value of their continued contributions to achieving Triad's objectives.

### Community, Marketing, and Growth (28.75%)

This is the largest allocation, dedicated to fueling the growth and expansion of Triad. The 28.75% portion will fund user engagement initiatives, marketing campaigns, community rewards, and strategic growth efforts to enhance the platform's adoption. It will also be used to onboard new users and drive awareness, ensuring Triad's presence in the broader blockchain ecosystem. As part of our growth strategy, we will conduct an airdrop featuring the "Tridents" – our new rewards system linked to Season Points. This airdrop will incentivize community participation and engagement, further aligning user interests with the success of Triad.
