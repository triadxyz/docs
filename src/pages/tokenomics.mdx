# **$TRD Distribution**

![triad-banner](/images/tokenomics.webp)

**Token** We are nearing the launch of our governance token, which will enable the community to influence decisions and the future of Triad. This token will give members the opportunity to actively participate in the platform's governance.

# **Angel Round: 30,000,000 TRD (3%)**
In the Angel Round, anyone can participate by purchasing a pass for the WAR, an exclusive collection of Poseidon and Aphrodite, available for 9 SOL. This pass not only grants access to the Angel Round but also offers exclusive benefits related to the project. However, there are only 99 slots available, making this opportunity even more limited and valuable for those who want to be part of our growth from the very beginning. The tokens allocated for this round will be unlocked gradually, starting 6 months after the Token Generation Event (TGE), with a vesting period that ensures alignment with the project’s long-term goals.

# **Angels Cliff:**

**Initial TGE Release:** At the Token Generation Event (TGE), Angels will receive an initial 5.55% of their allocated tokens. This upfront release is designed to provide immediate value while still aligning with our long-term goals.

**6-Month Cliff:** Following the initial release, the remaining tokens allocated to Angels will be locked for a period of 6 months. This lock-up period reflects our commitment to ensuring that our early supporters are aligned with the long-term success of the project. We believe this balance will give you the confidence to invest while understanding the importance of a strong, sustainable foundation.

**Gradual Vesting:** After the 6-month cliff, the remaining tokens will be released gradually over an 17-month period, with 5.55% of your allocated tokens unlocking each month. By the end of this vesting schedule, you will have full access to 100% of your tokens, allowing you to participate fully in the project's growth.

**Long-Term Commitment Bonus:** To reward those of you who are committed to our shared vision, we are offering an additional 5% bonus in tokens for those who hold their tokens without selling them during the first 12 months after the TGE. This bonus is our way of thanking you for your loyalty and helping to maintain the stability and value of our token in the early stages.

# **Rationale**

**Commitment and Alignment:** The 6-month cliff is designed to align our early supporters with the long-term success of the project. By carefully managing the token release, we aim to minimize market sell pressure, protecting the value of the token and ensuring a stable growth trajectory.

**Attractiveness:** We believe that a 6-month cliff followed by gradual vesting strikes the right balance between short-term accessibility and long-term value. This approach offers a clear and attractive timeline for when you will have access to your tokens.

**Additional Incentive:** The long-term commitment bonus is our way of encouraging you to stay engaged with the project and supporting the sustainable growth of our ecosystem. We value your contribution and want to ensure that your commitment is rewarded.

# **Seed Round: 100,000,000 TRD (10%)**
This portion of the token allocation is dedicated to the Seed Round, which is crucial for raising the capital needed for the initial development and expansion of Triad. The Seed Round tokens will be used to drive project growth and support early-stage operations.

The tokens from the Seed Round will be unlocked according to a vesting schedule. No TRD will be unlocked immediately.
