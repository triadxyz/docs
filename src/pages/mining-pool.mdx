# Ore Mining Pool

## What is a Mining Pool?

A mining pool is a group of cryptocurrency miners who combine their computational resources to work together on solving blocks and sharing rewards. Instead of mining individually, where the chances of solving a block can be very low due to high competition, miners join a pool to increase their chances of success.

When a hashblock is solved, the reward is distributed among the participants of the pool, usually according to the amount of processing power (hashrate) each miner contributed. This model allows miners to receive smaller, but more frequent, payments, rather than waiting a long time for a large reward.

## The Ore Widget

### What is a Widget?

Currently, Mining Pools are primarily targeted at people with VPS, usually developers. The Ore Widget, on the other hand, is a tool that can be easily embedded into any website, allowing regular users to mine with just one click, whether on a computer or a mobile device.

This widget shares the same mining pool as Triad, generating rewards for PICKAX holders.

## Pickax

### What is Pickax?

Pickax is a zero-risk mint that allows you to mine ORE through the widget you can mint here https://pickax.triadfi.co

### Multipliers

The ORE contract works in a way that the more ORE you are holding, the more rewards you will receive. The system offers a multiplier of up to 2x, which varies depending on the amount of tokens staked.

### Triad Pickax Multipliers (partner collections)

To receive the Triad multipliers, you must be a holder of one of the partner collections and have a Poseidon staked. Each Poseidon staked increases your multiplier.

### Mint and Rarities

Pickax is a zero-risk mint, allowing you to burn your NFT and retrieve the mint value. The mint price is 1 ORE + a fee of 0.10. Rarities will be defined after the mint out, creating rarities based on the time they were minted. The older the Pickax, the rarer it will become.

### Rewards

- Rewards through the widget tool can only be earned if you hold a Pickax.
- Rewards will be distributed weekly on Fridays, announced in a specific Discord channel.
- The announcement will detail the amount mined and the amount to be paid, which will be automatically dropped into the wallets holding the Pickax.

## Mining Pool Phases

### Phase 1: Testing

- Everyone contributes to the mining pool
- Hashs sent are limited to 1% of the total found

### Phase 2: Expansion

- Creation of 9 additional mining pools within Triad, totaling 10 mining pools
- These pools will send more hash and increase rewards
- Only the first mining pool will have the mint value in ORE staked
- The other 9 pools will receive only the amount generated from mining
