# Ore Mining Pool

## What is a Mining Pool?

A mining pool is a group of cryptocurrency miners who combine their computational resources to work together on solving blocks and sharing rewards. Instead of mining individually, where the chances of solving a block can be very low due to high competition, miners join a pool to increase their chances of success.

When a hashblock is solved, the reward is distributed among the participants of the pool, usually according to the amount of processing power (hashrate) each miner contributed. This model allows miners to receive smaller, but more frequent, payments, rather than waiting a long time for a large reward.

## The Ore Widget

### What is a Widget?

Currently, Mining Pools are primarily targeted at people with VPS, usually developers. The Ore Widget, on the other hand, is a tool that can be easily embedded into any website, allowing regular users to mine with just one click, whether on a computer or a mobile device.

This widget shares the same mining pool as Triad, generating rewards for PICKAX holders.

## Pickax

## What is Pickaxe?

**Pickaxe** is an NFT powered by TRIAD designed for mining the POW ORE token.

## History of Pickaxe

### Pickaxe Mint Free System
The Pickaxe Mint Free System has concluded. Previously, users could mint a Pickaxe with a single Ore, at no cost. To reclaim Ore, users could burn the Pickaxe.

### Ore Miner Widget
The Ore Miner Widget has been introduced on the Triad website, enabling efficient Ore mining with just one click.

### Multiplier on Atlantis
The Atlantis Season has launched on TriadFi, featuring enhanced multipliers designed to maximize rewards for participants.

### Monthly Ore Distribution
Pickaxe holders receive monthly distributions of mined Ore. These rewards are amplified by $TRD and are proportional to the mining power of the Pickaxe.

### Close Mint
The minting process for new Pickaxes has officially closed, setting the stage for the implementation of the forthcoming Pickaxe rarity system.

### Pickaxe Rarity by Mint Timestamp
The rarity and mining power of Pickaxes will now be determined by the mint timestamp. Earlier minted Pickaxes will possess greater mining power.

### Ecl1pse Pools Boost
The Ecl1pse Pool is now available to enhance Ore mining, offering a competitive 60% APR for the month of December 2024.

### Pickaxe Leveling System (Q4-2024 to Early Q1-2025)
A new Pickaxe leveling system will soon be introduced, providing the opportunity to permanently upgrade Pickaxes and increase both their mining power and reward potential.

### TriadPool (Q1-2025)
The Triad community pool is scheduled for launch in Q1-2025, further increasing rewards for Pickaxe holders and unlocking new earning opportunities.

## How Does Pickaxe Generate Revenue?

The Ores collected during the minting of Pickaxes are used for staking in an ORE pool, receiving a multiplier due to the high quantity. Through this, the ORE pool distributes rewards to stakers and, consequently, to Pickaxe holders.

## How Much Does It Earn?

Pickaxe earnings vary based on their rarity and number. The higher the rarity and the lower the number, the better the earnings distribution. Earnings can reach up to **84% APR** based on 1 ORE (the mint price of a Pickaxe).  
For more detailed information on each Pickaxe, check: **Pickaxe Dashboard**.

## How to Get a Pickaxe?

The Pickaxe minting process has ended. To acquire one now, it is only possible through the secondary market: [Tensor Trade](https://tensor.trade).


### Multipliers

The ORE contract works in a way that the more ORE you are holding, the more rewards you will receive. The system offers a multiplier of up to 2x, which varies depending on the amount of tokens staked.

### Triad Pickax Multipliers (partner collections)

To receive the Triad multipliers, you must be a holder of one of the partner collections and have a Poseidon staked. Each Poseidon staked increases your multiplier.

- The Undeads
- Coleta

### Mint and Rarities

Pickax is a zero-risk mint, allowing you to burn your NFT and retrieve the mint value. The mint price is 1 ORE + a fee of 0.10. Rarities will be defined after the mint out, creating rarities based on the time they were minted. The older the Pickax, the rarer it will become.

### Rewards

- Rewards through the widget tool can only be earned if you hold a Pickax.
- Rewards will be distributed weekly on Fridays, announced in a specific Discord channel.
- The announcement will detail the amount mined and the amount to be paid, which will be automatically dropped into the wallets holding the Pickax.

## Mining Pool Phases

### Phase 1: Testing

- Everyone contributes to the mining pool
- Hashs sent are limited to 1% of the total found

### Phase 2: Expansion

- Creation of 9 additional mining pools within Triad, totaling 10 mining pools
- These pools will send more hash and increase rewards
- Only the first mining pool will have the mint value in ORE staked
- The other 9 pools will receive only the amount generated from mining
